# Responsive Mockups

Take these designs and make them into a simple website!

## Get Started

- each folder has an `index.html` and a `main.css`
- each should have some starter code and the css should be linked. Check to make sure!
- Add elements and classes/ids, as needed
- Feel free to add colors and borders to help you visualize your page
- Remember - divs with no content, by default, have a height and width of 0. Use your dev tools and set min-height/min-width, as needed
- focus on overall layout - locations of elements and whether elements are bigger/smaller than others. Don't worry about getting all the proportions perfectly correct.
- Your learning will come from trying. Don't worry about having a perfect approach or solution before trying
